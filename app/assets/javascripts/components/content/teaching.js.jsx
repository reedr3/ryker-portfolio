          description="I give workshops on how to be an ally to the trans community. The workshop focuses on how to make your school or workplace more inclusive of trans and gender non-conforming people as well as how to be a personal ally. I provide resources, share personal anecdotes, and lead interactive activities during the workshop designed to give participants more insight into the lives of trans and non-binary people and the unique challenges they can face. I am available to come give a workshop at your school, workplace, or organization, so feel free to get in touch through my contact page!"

          description="I teach classes for middle and high schoolers about Middle Earth and its rich tapestry of languages. I created these classes because of my love of Linguistics and my love of Lord of the Rings. Tolkien himself was a linguist and imbued his world with an intricate linguistic history. I teach about the various languages seen throughout the books, as well as the evolution of the Elvish languages Sindarin and Quenya. I also cover two of Tolkiens invented alphabets, the Tengwar and the Angerthas."

I cover a variety of topics to give students an idea of what Linguistics is about and all the different subfields it covers. I teach them about everything from reduplication and infixation, to semantic satiation and the wug test. I also give them some interactive linguistic puzzles to solve using morpholigical analysis."
