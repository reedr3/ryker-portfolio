It won the MIT Louis Kampf Writing Prize in Women's and Gender Studies." description2="Sam is a college student who loves virtual reality. Alan is an android looking for a place in the world. After a chance meeting, a fast friendship blossoms between them. Even though much has advanced by the year 2040, the world is still not always kind to the ones it doesnâ€™t understand. The two friends unearth many questions for themselves and for society, questions of what it means to be human, and what it means to be true to yourself." image="https://media.licdn.com/media-proxy/ext?w=800&h=800&f=n&hash=PsHBYbLmA06UclvJK%2BlANZQAVqc%3D&ora=1%2CaFBCTXdkRmpGL2lvQUFBPQ%2CxAVta9Er0Vinkhwfjw8177yE41y87UNCVordEGXyD3u0qYrdf3Pof8SLebb3uVsTKiUclFZnLvL6STngD8a6Ioq6etxyisXgIY24ZxUBbFImi24" liveApp="http://gametheprogress.herokuapp.com/" liveAppName="Kindle Store" />
